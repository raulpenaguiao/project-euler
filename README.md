### Problem 122 - Efficient exponentiation

Features:
 - An exponentiation sequence is an *additive* sequence
 - BFS over all possible additive sequences that satisfy some lax inequalities
 - Runs in less than 20 seconds for < 190
 - Runs in 8 min < in UZH computers for m = 200

Bugs:
 - Memory goes bust for m > 190 in a laptop!

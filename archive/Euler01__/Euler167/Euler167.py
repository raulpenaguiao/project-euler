#Code written on the 18/06/2024
#Ulam sequences were studied already, and here is what we know for sequences starting with 2:
#   the differences are eventually periodic
#   there are only two even terms in the sequence
#   any other term is the sum of an even term and an odd term in the sequence
#   the periods were studied for all the given sizes and can be found here: S. Finch. Patterns in 1-additive Sequences. Experimental Mathematics, 1(1):57â€“63, 1992
#Expected to run in 7.805 seconds
